## Getting Set Up

Start R project named `congress-data`

-   Select git repo

-   Select `renv` because I like to complicate things (but the reproducibility!)

Try to send the repo to GitHub with `git push`. But I haven't added the repo on GitHub

```{r}
1 + 1
```

# Legislative data

Source: govInfo

Record of legislation introduced in the House and Senate of the US Congress. In this case, I am looking at the 117th Congress which was in power from January 2021 - January 2023.

How much legislation goes through congress?

How much on a given day?

How much legislation becomes law?

What kind of topics are the laws related to? What about all legislation proposed?

## Committees

How active are different committees?

-   How many different bills do they consider?

-   How many hearings do they hold?

-   How many bills do they report?
